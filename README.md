# rs-ff4

A somewhat clone of Final Fantasy IV in Rust.

## Features

- Contains a project for all game logic
- Contains a project for scraping assets from the PSP ISO
- Contains a project for scraping various definitions from the web (deprecated)

_DISCLAIMER_: This project will not include any assets from the original game. Tools will
be provided for scraping and extracting.

## Goals
- Provide a working recreation of Final Fantasy IV in a more customizable way
- Personally this is used to help me learn more about the Rust programming language
- Learn a newer graphics API such as Vulkan
- Learn how to use unsafe code

_NOTE_: This project currently uses OpenGL for rendering, but I'd like to learn Vulkan,
or preferrably, gfx-rs for the ease-of-use and portability.
